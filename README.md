README
This is a program that uses a pre-trained Keras model to classify images from a webcam in real-time. The program identifies objects and people and outputs the results with confidence scores. It is useful for security purposes, especially in schools and offices.

Requirements
Python 3
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
Discord (for sending messages)

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the program: python3 main.py
Allow the program to access your webcam.
The program will display the webcam output in a window.
Press the Esc key to exit the program.
The program will output the results and send a message to a Discord channel.

Configuration
Edit the labels.txt file to match the class names of the pre-trained model.
Edit the keras_model.h5 file to use your own pre-trained model.
Edit the records.xlsx file to match the students' information.
